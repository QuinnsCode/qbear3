alright so now we can finally get back to our game!we got a lot working for setup to almost be completemain bugs we have are:
~buying water commander does not unlock water territories to view
~we should show water territory at 60% opacity until someone owns a water commander then they are full view opacity
~if we cancel buying a commander we dont get energy refunded with option to buy again
~i cant place my commander when i buy it I need to place unit commander like how setup works for land or diplomat
~i want to see the cards game action button all the time as a reference tool
~we need to get card buying phase to work so i can have like a hand of cards and be able to buy from a deck and for now will always be a pick not a choose to remove it from the deckwhich sound easiest to get fixed first?EditLooking at your bug list, here's my ranking from easiest to hardest to fix:
ðŸŸ¢ EASIEST (Start Here!)
1. Show Cards Game Action Button Always

This is just a UI visibility change - probably just removing a conditional or changing when the button renders
Likely a one-line fix in your UI component

2. Water Territory Opacity (60% until commander owned)

Simple CSS/styling change based on commander ownership state
Add a condition to check if any player owns a water commander, then apply opacity

ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM DIFFICULTY
3. Energy Refund on Cancel Commander Purchase

Need to track "pending purchases" vs "completed purchases"
Add a cancel action that refunds energy and removes from purchasedItems
Requires some state management but straightforward logic

4. Commander Placement After Purchase (like setup)

This is mainly UI/UX - need to show placement interface after purchase
Similar to how setup works, just trigger the placement mode after buying

ðŸ”´ HARDER
5. Water Commander Unlocks Water Territory Viewing

This might involve territory visibility logic and how the map renders
Could be complex depending on how territory rendering is currently handled

6. Card Buying Phase Implementation

This is a whole new game phase with deck management, hand management, card selection UI
Most complex since it involves new game mechanics

ðŸŽ¯ My Recommendation:
Start with #1 (Cards button always visible) - quick win to get momentum going, then tackle #2 (water territory opacity). These two should take minutes, not hours!
Which one do you want to tackle first? I can help you identify exactly what needs to change! ðŸš€
