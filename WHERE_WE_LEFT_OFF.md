Perfect plan! Here's our roadmap for the next chat:

## 🎯 NEXT CHAT PLAN OF ATTACK

### ✅ WHAT'S WORKING NOW:
- **Setup Phase**: Perfect turn-by-turn progression (human → AI → human)
- **Bidding Phase**: Working correctly 
- **Collect Phase**: Shows income + space base auto-deployments
- **Deploy Phase**: Banner UI + map interaction (needs verification)

### 🔍 IMMEDIATE VERIFICATION NEEDED:
1. **Test Deploy Phase**: Confirm units place correctly via map like setup does
2. **Verify Progression**: Deploy → Confirm → Phase 2 advancement working
3. **Check AI Flow**: AI collects + deploys automatically like setup

### 🎯 NEXT FEATURE: PHASE 2 - BUILD & HIRE OVERLAY

**Requirements:**
- **Hire Commanders**: 3 energy each (Land, Diplomat, Nuke, Water)
- **Buy Space Stations**: 5 energy each 
- **UI Pattern**: Follow same overlay pattern as CollectDeploy
- **Map Interaction**: Click territories to place purchased items
- **AI Logic**: AI makes purchasing decisions automatically

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create `BuildHireOverlay.tsx` (copy CollectDeploy pattern)
2. Add purchase logic to game reducer 
3. Add server actions for hiring/buying
4. Test human → AI progression like setup
5. Verify Phase 2 → Phase 3 advancement

**Key Pattern to Follow:**
- Full overlay for purchasing decisions
- Banner for placement actions using map
- Same progression logic as setup (wait for completion before advancing)

Ready to crush Phase 2! 🚀
